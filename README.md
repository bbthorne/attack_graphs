The contents of this repository are the supplementary code snippets from 
"Using Attack Graphs to Understand Vulnerabilities". It includes two files 
with Python source code:
	AttackGraph.py : contains a class that represents an attack graph
	resolve.py     : contains code to come up with a course of action
                         when given an exploited attack graph

To run, please ensure that you have networkx installed.
